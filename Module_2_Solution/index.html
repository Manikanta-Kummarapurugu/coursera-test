                        The chicken (Gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the
                        red
                        junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food,
                        providing
                        meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.

                        Lorem ipsum A fish (pl.: fish or fishes) is an aquatic, anamniotic, gill-bearing vertebrate
                        animal with swimming
                        fins and a hard skull, but lacking limbs with digits. Fish can be grouped into the more basal
                        jawless fish and the more common jawed fish, the latter including all living cartilaginous and
                        bony
                        fish, as well as the extinct placoderms and acanthodians. Most fish are cold-blooded, their body
                        temperature varying with the surrounding water, though some large active swimmers like white
                        shark
                        and tuna can hold a higher core temperature. Many fish can communicate acoustically with each
                        other,
                        such as during courtship displays. sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Culpa perferendis
